						<div class="policy__dark">Cookies used on the site:</div>
						<ul class="policy__list">
							<li class="policy__list-item"><span class="policy__dark-text">User preference</span> – we set these to customise your website preferences, for example dismissing a popup not to show again in your browser, or setting your live chat preferences.</li>

							<li class="policy__list-item"><span class="policy__dark-text">AdWords:</span> Using Google AdWords code we are able to see which pages helped lead to contact form submissions.

We cannot prevent these sites, or external domains, from setting their own cookies and collecting information on your usage. If you are not logged in to these external services then they will not know who you are but are likely to gather anonymous usage information e.g. number of views, plays, loads etc.</li>
