By providing written notice to the other party during the Minimum Term or Renewal Term either party may elect to terminate this Agreement upon (but not before) expiry of the Minimum Term or Renewal Term. For the avoidance of doubt, parties are entitled to give 30 days written notice to terminate the agreement at any time within the Minimum Term or any subsequent Renewal Term, however termination will not occur until the end of the relevant Minimum Term or Renewal Term.</p>
						<p class="policy__text">13.2             Either party may terminate the Agreement immediately by giving written notice to the other party if:</p>

						<p class="policy__text">(ii)                  becomes insolvent or is declared insolvent;</p>
						<p class="policy__text">(b)               an administrator, administrative receiver, liquidator, receiver, trustee, manager or similar is appointed over any of the assets of the other party;</p>
						<p class="policy__text">(c)               an order is made for the winding up of the other party, or the other party passes a resolution for its winding up (other than for the purpose of a solvent company reorganisation where the resulting entity will assume all the obligations of the other party under the Agreement);</p>
						<p class="policy__text">(d)               (where that other party is an individual) that other party dies, or as a result of illness or incapacity becomes incapable of managing his or her own affairs, or is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or order.</p>
						<p class="policy__text">13.3 The Customer may terminate before expiry of the Minimum Term or Renewal Term, subject to it making a payment of a sum equivalent to 85% of the fees payable for the remainder of the Minimum Term or Renewal Term.
